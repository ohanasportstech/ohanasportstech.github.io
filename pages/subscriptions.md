## Early Access: Free Through 2025

Right now, **Kai is completely free to use**.  

We invite everyone who belongs to a participating tennis club in the Pacific Northwest to try Kai, train with our drills, and give feedback - tell us what you think!

Starting in 2026, we will be introducing subscription plans to help us continue building something truly special and support our community.

- **Work with professional coaches** to create and continuously update our drill library with fresh, high-quality training content.  
- **Maintain our cloud platform** that enables us to continuously roll out new drills, lets users design and share custom drills, and enables coaches to manage training programs for their players and teams.  
- **Keep improving the experience** with new features, smarter coaching tools, and better ways to help you reach your tennis goals.

## What to Expect

When we launch subscriptions in 2026, we’ll offer **a few simple, flexible tiers** to match different players’ needs:

- **Essentials** – For players who use a ball machine occasionally and want a super easy way to start and stop basic drills.  
- **Premium** – For players ready to push their game further with rally-style simulations, advanced drills, and skill-focused training.  
- **Pro** – For coaches, parents, and team captains who want to create custom training plans, assign drills, and share them with students, children, or teammates.

As we get closer to launch, we’ll share **full details on pricing, features, and club plans** so you can choose the best fit.
