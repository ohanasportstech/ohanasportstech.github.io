# Subscriptions Coming in 2026

We’re thrilled to share what’s next for **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**.  
Our journey is just beginning — and 2025 is your chance to get in early, explore everything, and help shape the future of Kai.

## Early Access: Free Through 2025

Right now, **Kai is completely free to use**.  
We’re in our Early Access period through the end of 2025, and we want everyone to be able to try Kai, play with our drills, and give feedback while we continue building something truly special.

## Why Subscriptions?

Starting in 2026, Kai will move to a **subscription-based model**. This helps us:

- **Work with professional coaches** to create and continuously update our drill library with fresh, high-quality training content.  
- **Maintain our powerful cloud platform** that lets users design and share custom drills, and enables coaches to manage training programs for their players and teams.  
- **Keep improving the experience** with new features, smarter coaching tools, and better ways to help you reach your tennis goals.

## What to Expect

When we launch subscriptions in 2026, we’ll offer **a few simple, flexible tiers** to match different players’ needs:

- **Essentials** – For players who use a ball machine occasionally and want a super easy way to start and stop basic drills.  
- **Performance** – For players ready to push their game further with rally-style simulations, advanced drills, and skill-focused training.  
- **Coaches & Families** – For coaches, parents, and team captains who want to create custom training plans, assign drills, and share them with students, children, or teammates.

As we get closer to launch, we’ll share **full details on pricing, features, and club plans** so you can choose the best fit.

## We’re Just Getting Started

We can’t wait to fully launch Kai in 2026.  
Until then, enjoy unlimited access for free in 2025 — and thank you for being part of this exciting journey from the start.

Let’s rally together and make training smarter, more fun, and more connected.  
**– The Kai Team**
